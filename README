msh.cpp:
Compilation/Design:
I chose not to use any header files.
msh.cpp compiles with makefile using [g++ -std=c++11 -o msh msh.cpp -Wall] successfully
Code:
Uses a scanner and a parser to change input into tokens. These tokens are then taken in and separated into commands, variables, and comments.
Known bugs/errors:
Occasionally the shell with have a segmentation fault. I haven't been able to pinpoint what causes it. It usually happens in strange circumstances. Running 'run echo ^PATH' will not replace with a variable correctly.
